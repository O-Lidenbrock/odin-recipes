        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Perfect for a late Saturday morning, with the mixings from last night's salad, this omelette recipe is quick enough to be made before a busy workday. In a cast iron skillet this recipe browns beautifully, and the cirular pan helps fold it perfectly</p>
        <p>Prep time is about 10 minutes, depending what you cut up. I like to add some leeks and cubed mozzarella which takes more time. Cook time is about 5 min</p>
